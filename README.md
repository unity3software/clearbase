# Official Clearbase Release

## The Problem
When I came on board as a Wordpress CMS developer, I noticed (disappointingly) that there was no truly easy way for a novice user to create and maintain a photo gallery.  There was no way that I was going to expect my clients to create a post, set the the title, set the featured image, create a gallery to be hard wired into the post, etc.  I wanted functionality that would be as native as a post or page. 

## Introducing Clearbase
With Clearbase, we now have native Wordpress folders which the user can use to upload media using the same UI that they're already accustomed to using in the Media screen.  Because the folder structure is native to the Wordpress post type, it can be integrated easily into the Wordpress workflow.  For example, you can add a Clearbase Folder to the your menu structure just like Posts or Pages.

## Where It Gets Better
Clearbase introduces the concept of Controllers.   A Clearbase controller can be set to *'control'* the UI of a Clearbase folder.  For example, Clearbase comes pre-loaded with a controller called FlexSlider.  This controller will transform a folder into a mobile responsive image slider.   All of this is possible without writing *one line of code or shortcode*

In short, Clearbase make media managment easier for the developer and easier for the user.  Enjoy!
